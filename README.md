# From Tedious to Effortless

## Streamlined Data Updates with Python

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I first joined, processing day-to-day data updates for the Sears
plan was a painfully manual process.

Every month, we’d comb through tickets in an internal ticket system,
manually updating a massive Excel ‘database’ file and working on a
separate ‘maintenance file’ — a critical file sent monthly to CIBC
Mellon to update their systems.

The process was so tedious it led to skipped steps and one of my first
tasks when I joined was reconciling incongruent data between the
internal and external databases. Shortly afterwards, I took ownership of
the entire data update process.

Now, the entire workflow is streamlined in a scalable, maintainable
system:

- tickets are exported automatically for quick review and minor edits  
- the database updates are automated via scripts and macros  
- maintenance files are generated automatically with only minor
  revisions needed at the end

**What once took hours of manual work now runs automatically in a
fraction of the time with near-perfect accuracy.**

## Key Features

- **Automated Ticket Scraping**

  The [Harmony Automation](./11_harmony_automation.ipynb) module
  streamlines data collection by automatically scraping all comments and
  notes from tickets in our internal system — **no more manual
  copy-pasting or tedious browser navigation**.

  Scraped comments are automatically cleaned, formatted, and sorted
  chronologically, turning raw text into clear, structured insights.

- **Seamless Data Extraction – Minimal Effort, Maximum Efficiency**

  Scraped ticket data lands **automatically in a spreadsheet**,
  requiring only **light manual tweaks** — just enough to let the `core`
  module work its magic. From there, it intelligently **extracts
  structured data** from notes, transforming messy text into clean,
  structured data. No tedious preprocessing — just **quick edits,
  effortless automation**, and ready-to-use data.

  For example, the `core` module will automatically extract the address,
  email, and phone number update from the following:

  You can probably begin to imagine how much time and effort this saves,
  especially with hundreds of such updates/tickets.

- **Integrated Data Enrichment**

  The tracking spreadsheet pulls in additional supplementary data from
  various sources using Power Query, including reports from CIBC Mellon
  (plan custodian) and our internal databases, to support a
  comprehensive set of features.

  For example, if a member dies, a note will be generated advising of
  any further entitlements owed (remaining guarantee period, survivor
  benefits, etc.). This note is added automatically when re-assigning
  the tickets to the colleague that handles those processes.

- **Effortless System Synchronization**

  Tired of manually tracking which systems need to be updated? This
  package **automatically determines** where changes should be applied —
  whether internal, external (plan custodian), or both.

  And the beauty is it’s **fully extendable**, able to handle virtually
  any update, automatically determining which system is affected and
  automatically **tweaking the update to meet the requirements of that
  particular system**. As the package evolves, more features are added,
  further turning complexity into simplicity.

- **Automated Data Updates in Seconds**

  This package transforms raw input spreadsheets into standardized Excel
  files — ready to update internal databases and external systems. It
  minimizes the need for manual reformatting and reduces processing time
  from hours to minutes, all while maintaining flawless data
  consistency.

  For updates to the internal database, the
  [update_xl](./08_update_xl.ipynb) module also generates detailed,
  **human-readable changelogs showing exactly what changes were made and
  when**.

- **Automated Ticket Closing / Re-assigning**

  The [Harmony Automation](./11_harmony_automation.ipynb) module
  contains functions to automate the closing and re-assigning of
  tickets, which means no more manually closing and re-assigning tickets
  and tedious browser navigation/actions.

  This is particularly useful during periods of higher ticket volumes,
  such as after sending out communications, option forms, etc.
